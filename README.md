# Practical Microservices in Spring
In this project, I develop the same project as the book [Practical Microservices - Build Event-Driven Architectures with Event Sourcing and CQRS (Ethan Garofolo - The Pragmatic Programmer)](https://pragprog.com/titles/egmicro/practical-microservices/) but using SpringBoot and Java21 instead of NodeJS.
